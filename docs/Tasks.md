## Credit Budget & Runway ($2000 Google Cloud Credits)

### Monthly Budget Allocation
- **Development & Testing** (Months 1-2): $400/month
  - Vertex AI Endpoints: $200
  - Cloud Run/Functions: $50
  - Storage & Firestore: $50
  - Testing generations: $100

- **User Validation** (Months 3-4): $420/month
  - Infrastructure: $400
  - User testing (1000 users Ã— 10 images): $20

- **Revenue Ramp** (Month 5): $500
  - First paying customers
  - Break-even target: 15-20 paying users

### Cost Targets
- **SDXL Generation**: $0.002 per image
- **Imagen Premium**: $0.02 per image
- **LoRA Training**: $10-20 per custom style
- **Break-even**: $200/month revenue (10 Pro users)
- **Profitable**: $500+/month (25+ Pro users)

## Future Considerations
- [ ] Terraform/IaC for production environments
- [ ] CI/CD with preview channels
- [ ] Advanced observability (beyond basic logging)
- [ ] Multi-model orchestration (DALL-E, Midjourney fallbacks)
- [ ] Multi-region deployment for global scaling

## Important Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Google-Native Stack**: Vertex AI Model Garden (SDXL) + Imagen 3 for hybrid generation
- **Route Groups**: Use Next.js route groups for clean separation between marketing and app interfaces
- **Navigation Strategy**: Context-aware navigation (full nav for marketing, minimal for app)
- **Single App Page**: Consolidate app functionality in /app with tabbed sections vs separate routes
- **Cost-Efficient Generation**: SDXL (~$0.002) as default, Imagen 3 (~$0.02) as premium
- **Style Strategy**: LoRA fine-tuning on Vertex AI Training, not prompt engineering
- **Credit Runway**: 4-5 months with $2000 Google Cloud credits, prioritize revenue
- **Vector Reality Check**: "AI-optimized vectors" not "professional vectors" - set expectations
- **Revenue First**: Payment integration in Phase 4, before vector conversion
- **Security & Budgets**: App Check, billing alerts, and cost monitoring to prevent overruns

### Development Principles
- **Credit-Conscious**: Every decision optimized for $2000 runway efficiency
- **Revenue Focus**: Prioritize monetization over advanced features
- **Google Ecosystem**: Leverage Google Cloud credits and managed services
- **Realistic Expectations**: Be honest about AI limitations, especially vectors
- **Start Simple**: PNG/JPG generation first, add complexity based on user demand
- **Measure Everything**: Track credit burn rate and user engagement closely
