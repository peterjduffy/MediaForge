### Initial Setup
- Created CLAUDE.md configuration file
- Set up docs folder structure
- Initialized project documentation

### Project Definition
- Building a clone of illustrationsai.com
- Focus on AI-powered illustration generation with vector output
- Google Cloud native architecture chosen

### Architecture Decisions
- **AI Stack**: Vertex AI Imagen 3/4 for base generation
- **Custom Styles**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning
  - Allows brand-specific style training
  - Faster than full model retraining
  - Stackable for style mixing
- **Vector Pipeline**: Cloud Run containers with Potrace/imagetracer
  - Raster to vector conversion
  - SVG optimization
  - EPS/PDF export via Inkscape
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Next.js SSR on Cloud Run for dynamic rendering
  - Firestore for data persistence
  - Cloud Storage for file management
  - Cloud Tasks for job queuing
  - Stripe for payments

### Key Features Identified
- Multiple illustration styles
- Custom brand style training
- Vector output (SVG, EPS, PDF)
- Credit-based system
- Style consistency across generations

### Project State
- Next.js application with Firebase integration
- Dependencies: Next.js 15.5.2, React 19.1.0, Firebase 12.3.0
- Firebase project: mediaforge-957e4
- Using Turbopack for development and builds
- Blueprint.md merged into main docs and deleted

### Current Status
- Documentation structure established
- Architecture defined based on Google Cloud stack
- Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation

### Progress Made
- Installed Google Cloud dependencies (@google-cloud/firestore, storage, tasks, stripe)
- Created comprehensive .env.local template with all required configurations
- Built foundational service layer:
  - TypeScript types for all data models (User, Generation, StylePack, Transaction, JobQueue)
  - Firestore service with user, generation, style, and transaction operations
  - Storage service with signed URL generation and file management
  - Queue service for Cloud Tasks integration
- Project structure organized with components, services, hooks, and types directories
- Cleaned up redundant blueprint.md file

### Phase 1 Foundation Setup - COMPLETED ✅

#### Architecture Refinements Based on Expert Feedback
- **Updated AI Strategy**: Replaced LoRA fine-tuning with Vertex AI Imagen 3/4 native style customization
  - More appropriate for image generation (LoRA is primarily for text models)
  - Uses Vertex AI's built-in style/subject customization APIs
  - Prioritize Imagen 4 for better typography, fallback to Imagen 3
- **Vector Pipeline Enhancement**: Switched from Potrace to VTracer
  - VTracer handles full-color illustrations vs Potrace's B&W limitation
  - Better suited for our use case of colorful AI-generated illustrations
- **Security-First Approach**: Added Phase 0 for critical infrastructure
  - Firebase App Check, budgets/alerts, Secret Manager
  - Prevents abuse and cost overruns early

#### Firebase Auth Implementation
- **Email Link Authentication**: Passwordless sign-in via magic links
- **Google OAuth**: One-click Google sign-in integration
- **User Management**: Automatic Firestore user records with 10 free credits
- **Session Handling**: React context with protected routes
- **UI Components**: Complete auth flow with sign-in, verification, user menu

#### Firestore Database Setup
- **Collections & Security Rules**: Users, generations, style packs, transactions, job queue
- **CRUD Operations**: Client-side and server-side utilities
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries for common operations
- **Credit System**: Foundation for transactional credit decrements

#### Cloud Storage Infrastructure
- **7 Specialized Buckets**: User uploads, generated images, vector outputs, style packs, training data, temp uploads, public assets
- **Security Configuration**: User-specific access via Firebase Auth, public assets bucket
- **Lifecycle Management**: Temp uploads auto-delete after 24 hours
- **Automated Setup**: Script for bucket creation and configuration
- **Storage Utilities**: Upload, validation, and file management functions

#### User Dashboard
- **Welcome Interface**: Credits display, quick actions, recent generations
- **Authentication Flow**: Complete sign-in/verification pages
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard requires authentication
- **User Menu**: Profile, settings, billing navigation

### Phase 0 MVP Revision
- **Removed Overkill Items**: Budgets, Secret Manager, App Check, content policy → moved to Phase 7
- **Kept MVP Essentials**: Transactional credit decrements (already implemented), basic error logging
- **Reasoning**: Focus on core functionality first, security hardening comes later

### Homepage Implementation (2025-09-22 Evening)
- **HTML to Next.js Conversion**: Successfully converted user's homepage HTML to Next.js
- **Font Integration**: Manrope font properly loaded with next/font/google
- **Navigation Updates**: Converted to Next.js Link components, CTAs point to /auth/signin
- **Content Preservation**: Maintained all user copy exactly as written
- **Technical Improvements**: Added TypeScript, React state management, proper form handling
- **Design Integrity**: Preserved pink gradient theme, card layouts, responsive design

### Current State
- **Phase 0**: Security & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE (MVP essentials only)
- **Phase 1**: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2**: Core UI Development - Homepage ✅ COMPLETE
- **Next**: Build main generation interface (/app)

### Key Files Created
- Authentication: `src/lib/auth.ts`, auth components
- Database: `src/lib/firestore-collections.ts`, `firestore.rules`
- Storage: `src/lib/storage.ts`, `scripts/setup-storage.sh`
- UI: Dashboard, auth pages, protected routes
- Documentation: `docs/storage-setup.md`

### Daily Wrap-Up
- Authored `AGENTS.md` contributor guidelines reflecting the Google-first architecture and Firebase Studio workflow.
- Logged today's shutdown notes here to capture state before powering down.
- Pending for next session: review `AGENTS.md`, stage both it and this journal update, and run lint/build if planning to deploy.
- Shutting down for the day; resume with generation interface work when back.
