### Phase 1 Foundation Setup - COMPLETED ✅

#### Architecture Refinements Based on Expert Feedback
- **Updated AI Strategy**: Replaced LoRA fine-tuning with Vertex AI Imagen 3/4 native style customization
  - More appropriate for image generation (LoRA is primarily for text models)
  - Uses Vertex AI's built-in style/subject customization APIs
  - Prioritize Imagen 4 for better typography, fallback to Imagen 3
- **Vector Pipeline Enhancement**: Switched from Potrace to VTracer
  - VTracer handles full-color illustrations vs Potrace's B&W limitation
  - Better suited for our use case of colorful AI-generated illustrations
- **Security-First Approach**: Added Phase 0 for critical infrastructure
  - Firebase App Check, budgets/alerts, Secret Manager
  - Prevents abuse and cost overruns early

#### Firebase Auth Implementation
- **Email Link Authentication**: Passwordless sign-in via magic links
- **Google OAuth**: One-click Google sign-in integration
- **User Management**: Automatic Firestore user records with 10 free credits
- **Session Handling**: React context with protected routes
- **UI Components**: Complete auth flow with sign-in, verification, user menu

#### Firestore Database Setup
- **Collections & Security Rules**: Users, generations, style packs, transactions, job queue
- **CRUD Operations**: Client-side and server-side utilities
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries for common operations
- **Credit System**: Foundation for transactional credit decrements

#### Cloud Storage Infrastructure
- **7 Specialized Buckets**: User uploads, generated images, vector outputs, style packs, training data, temp uploads, public assets
- **Security Configuration**: User-specific access via Firebase Auth, public assets bucket
- **Lifecycle Management**: Temp uploads auto-delete after 24 hours
- **Automated Setup**: Script for bucket creation and configuration
- **Storage Utilities**: Upload, validation, and file management functions

#### User Dashboard
- **Welcome Interface**: Credits display, quick actions, recent generations
- **Authentication Flow**: Complete sign-in/verification pages
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard requires authentication
- **User Menu**: Profile, settings, billing navigation

### Phase 0 MVP Revision
- **Removed Overkill Items**: Budgets, Secret Manager, App Check, content policy → moved to Phase 7
- **Kept MVP Essentials**: Transactional credit decrements (already implemented), basic error logging
- **Reasoning**: Focus on core functionality first, security hardening comes later

### Homepage Implementation (2025-09-22 Evening)
- **HTML to Next.js Conversion**: Successfully converted user's homepage HTML to Next.js
- **Font Integration**: Manrope font properly loaded with next/font/google
- **Navigation Updates**: Converted to Next.js Link components, CTAs point to /auth/signin
- **Content Preservation**: Maintained all user copy exactly as written
- **Technical Improvements**: Added TypeScript, React state management, proper form handling
- **Design Integrity**: Preserved pink gradient theme, card layouts, responsive design

### Current State
- **Phase 0**: Security & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE (MVP essentials only)
- **Phase 1**: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2**: Core UI Development - Homepage ✅ COMPLETE
- **Next**: Build main generation interface (/app)

### Key Files Created
- Authentication: `src/lib/auth.ts`, auth components
- Database: `src/lib/firestore-collections.ts`, `firestore.rules`
- Storage: `src/lib/storage.ts`, `scripts/setup-storage.sh`
- UI: Dashboard, auth pages, protected routes

### Navigation Strategy & Architecture Planning

#### Major Architectural Decision: Route Groups Implementation
- **Context**: Discussed navigation strategy for MediaForge - should top nav/footer be global or different between marketing and app?
- **Research**: Analyzed Next.js route groups best practices and IllustrationsAI app structure
- **Decision**: Implement route groups with distinct layouts:
  - `(marketing)/` group: Full navigation + footer for public pages
  - `/app` route: Minimal nav (logo, credits, user menu) for focused workspace
  - `/auth/*` routes: Minimal layout (logo only) for conversion focus

#### IllustrationsAI Analysis & App Structure
- **User Insight**: Referenced IllustrationsAI's app homepage with different sections (home, styles, gallery)
- **MediaForge Adaptation**: Decided on single `/app` page with tabbed sections:
  - Generate section (default) - main creation interface
  - Styles section - browse available styles
  - Gallery section - user's generation history
- **Navigation**: Credits display + user menu in top bar, no footer to maximize workspace

#### Content Strategy for New Product Launch
- **Challenge**: MediaForge is a new project without social proof (testimonials, logos, user stats)
- **Solution**: Keep comprehensive content on homepage to build trust:
  - Hero + Features + Styles preview + Use Cases + How it Works + FAQ
  - Defer separate pages (About, Contact, Examples) until post-launch
  - Focus on technology credibility ("Powered by Google AI") and early access incentives

#### Documentation Updates Completed
- **Architecture.md**: Updated with route groups, navigation strategy, trust-building approach
- **navigation-strategy.md**: New comprehensive doc covering implementation details
- **app-structure.md**: New detailed breakdown of `/app` interface design
- **Tasks.md**: Revised Phase 2 priorities for route group implementation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated project structure to reflect route groups

#### MVP Page Structure Finalized
**Marketing Pages** (simplified for launch):
- `/` - Comprehensive homepage (current content stays)
- `/styles` - Full style gallery
- `/pricing` - Pricing plans (when ready)
- `/blog` - Content marketing
- `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/security` - Legal compliance

**App Interface**:
- `/app` - Single page with tabbed sections (Generate, Styles, Gallery)

**Auth Flow**:
- `/auth/signin`, `/auth/verify` - Minimal layouts

#### Key Insights for New Products
- Comprehensive homepage builds trust without social proof
- Technology partnerships provide credibility ("Powered by Google AI")
- Early access incentives motivate signups
- Fewer pages initially = less maintenance burden
- Can expand pages as traction builds

### Current State
- **Phase 2**: Navigation architecture documented and planned
- **Next Session**: Implement route group structure and navigation components
- **Progress**: Foundation solid, ready for UI implementation

### Session Impact
This session established the complete navigation and content strategy for MediaForge's launch, balancing SaaS best practices with the realities of being a new product. The route group approach provides a scalable foundation while the comprehensive homepage strategy addresses trust-building without existing social proof.
