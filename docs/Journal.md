## 2025-10-06 - Codebase Security & Architecture Fixes

**Objective**: Comprehensive review and fixes for security vulnerabilities, architectural issues, and code inconsistencies.

### Critical Security Fixes

**1. Exposed API Key Secured** ([.env.local](.env.local))
- Invalidated exposed OpenAI API key (was visible in file)
- Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to production URL: `https://mediaforge-957e4.web.app`
- Created `.env.example` template for safe onboarding
- **Action Required**: Rotate OpenAI key at platform.openai.com

**2. Firestore Security Rules** ([firestore.rules](firestore.rules))
- Added missing rules for `illustrations`, `teams`, `teamInvites` collections
- Implemented helper functions: `isTeamMember()`, `isTeamOwner()`
- Secured team library access (members can read team illustrations)
- Protected brand styles subcollection under `/users/{userId}/brands`
- Prevented unauthorized team operations

### High Priority Architecture Fixes

**3. Consolidated Duplicate AuthProvider**
- Removed duplicate `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Unified all imports to use `src/components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx`
- Fixed type inconsistencies (Firebase User vs custom User type)
- Updated files: `/settings`, `/team`, `/team/accept`, `BrandTrainingModal`

**4. Centralized Credit Management** ([src/lib/credits.ts](src/lib/credits.ts))
- Created shared utility with `getCreditsForPlan()` and `getCreditsForResolution()`
- Fixed hardcoded values (Business = 200 credits, not 700)
- Updated 5 files to use centralized logic: `AppNav`, `app/page`, `library/page`, `ai-generation`
- Eliminated duplicate code across codebase

**5. Fixed Credit Deduction Timing** ([src/lib/ai-generation.ts](src/lib/ai-generation.ts))
- **Critical Bug**: Credits were deducted BEFORE generation (lost on failures)
- Now deducts credits AFTER successful completion
- Pre-flight check for sufficient credits
- Prevents credit loss on API errors or generation failures

### Medium Priority Fixes

**6. Re-enabled ProtectedRoute** ([src/app/library/page.tsx](src/app/library/page.tsx))
- Library page was commented out, allowing public access
- Uncommented `<ProtectedRoute>` wrapper
- Now requires authentication to view illustrations

**7. Firebase Emulator Connection Logging** ([src/lib/firebase.ts](src/lib/firebase.ts))
- Added verbose connection logging for Auth, Firestore, Storage emulators
- Warns if running in development without emulators
- Prevents accidental production database writes during development
- Clear console messages with emoji indicators

**8. Cleaned Git Tracking**
- Removed `firebase-debug.log` from git tracking (2846 lines)
- Already in `.gitignore`, now removed from repo

### Impact Summary

- **Security**: Closed 2 critical vulnerabilities (exposed key, missing Firestore rules)
- **Reliability**: Fixed credit deduction bug that could lose user money
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated 4 sources of duplicate code
- **Developer Experience**: Better emulator warnings, clearer error messages

- **Credit Tracking**: Full integration with existing Firestore credit system

#### Deployment Challenges Resolved
- Fixed Cloud Build service account permissions for Artifact Registry
- Granted proper upload permissions to build artifacts
- Configured Cloud Run to use functions-framework properly
- Successfully deployed after permission configuration

### Pricing Strategy Evolution

After extensive analysis comparing LoRA vs Imagen 3 costs, finalized simple 2-tier structure:

#### Final Pricing (2-Tier Model)
**Free: $0/month**
- 10 credits on signup, then 10/month
- Preset styles only (Imagen 3)
- 1024px PNG/JPG only
- Purpose: Try quality, zero friction

**Business: $29/month**
- 200 credits/month (shared across unlimited team members)
- Preset styles + Brand Mode
- One-time brand training included ($29 value) - train once, use forever
- Additional brand trainings: $29 each (one-time)
- Brand refresh: $5 (update existing brand)
- All resolutions (1024/1536 = 1 credit, 2048 = 2 credits)
- Export presets
- Team workspace (unlimited members, fair-use)

**Add-ons:**
- Extra credits: $5 per 100
- Additional brand training: $29 (one-time)
- Brand refresh: $5 (one-time)

#### Key Pricing Decisions
1. **Removed middle tiers**: Simpler choice (Free to test, Business to use)
2. **Brand training included**: Makes $29 incredible value vs competitors
3. **Unlimited team members**: No seat fees, credits are the limit
4. **Resolution-based pricing**: 1024/1536 = 1 credit, 2048 = 2 credits
5. **One-time training**: Train once, use forever (not recurring)

### Architecture: Transparent Model Selection

#### Generation Strategy
**Free Tier:**
- Imagen 3 only with preset styles

**Business Tier (Invisible to User):**
- Before brand training: Imagen 3 with saved brand colors/keywords
- After brand training: Automatically switches to SDXL + LoRA
- User just selects "Your Brand" style - backend handles routing
- No "Quick Mode" vs "Brand Mode" choices

#### Brand Training UX (Async, Optional)
1. Business signup → Pay $29
2. **Optional** brand upload during onboarding (can skip)
3. Upload 10-30 images, pick colors, add description
4. Training runs in **background** (15-30 min)
5. User generates immediately with presets while waiting
6. **Toast notification** when brand AI is ready
7. Future generations automatically use SDXL + LoRA
8. Can add brand later from Settings if skipped

#### Key UX Principles
- **No forced waiting**: Instant value after payment
- **Transparent intelligence**: Backend chooses best model
- **Optional training**: Can skip and add later
- **Seamless switching**: Imagen 3 → SDXL happens automatically
- **Zero mode selection**: User experience is simple

### Cost Analysis & Runway

#### Real LoRA Costs (Corrected)
- **Training**: ~$1 per brand (Vertex AI Training, 1-2 hours)
- **Inference (scale-to-zero)**: ~$0.014 per image (Cloud Run with L4 GPU)
- **Infrastructure (10 users)**: ~$22/month with cold starts
- **Infrastructure (100 users)**: ~$400/month with warm instances

#### Revenue Projections
- **10 Business users**: $290 revenue, $22 costs = $268 profit (92% margin)
- **30 Business users**: $870 revenue, $90 costs = $780 profit
- **100 Business users**: $2,900 revenue, $400 costs = $2,500 profit

#### Strategic Decision
With realistic expectation of 10 clients in first month, proceed with **Phase 4 (LoRA)** before Phase 5 (Payments):
- Low risk: $22/month cost is negligible
- High value: Brand training is competitive moat
- Natural scaling: Costs rise with revenue
- Cold starts acceptable: 10 users won't overlap much

### Production Deployment
- **Build**: Next.js static export successful
- **Deploy**: Firebase Hosting updated
- **Live URL**: https://mediaforge-957e4.web.app
- **Status**: Real Imagen 3 generation operational
- **Ready for**: Phase 4 - LoRA training implementation

### Impact
MediaForge has completed the transition from mock to real AI generation. Imagen 3 is live and generating real illustrations at $0.03/image. The pricing strategy has been simplified to a compelling 2-tier model with brand training as the key differentiator. With realistic cost projections showing 92% margins at initial scale, the path is clear to implement LoRA training (Phase 4) before payment integration (Phase 5).
