Subject: Your MediaForge Beta Access - Let's Get You Set Up!

Hi [Name],

Excited to have you as one of our first 10 beta users! 🎉

I'd love to watch you use MediaForge for the first time. This isn't a demo - I want to see your genuine first experience so I can learn what works and what doesn't.

📅 When: [Date/Time]
🔗 Zoom: [Link]

What to prepare:
✅ 10-30 brand illustrations (if you have them - blog headers, social graphics, etc.)
✅ Your brand colors (hex codes if you have them)
❌ Don't watch tutorials or prepare anything else - I want your fresh eyes!

During the call:
- Screen share the whole time
- Think aloud as you click around
- Be brutally honest - negative feedback is the most valuable

As a thank you, you'll get 3 months of Business plan free ($87 value).

See you on [Day]!

[Your name]
```

**Internal prep:**
- [ ] Open [brand-training-observations.md](brand-training-observations.md) template
- [ ] Test screen recording software
- [ ] Review their waitlist submission (use case, company)
- [ ] Look up their company website to see existing brand style
- [ ] Have [brand-training-quality-rubric.md](brand-training-quality-rubric.md) handy

## Call Structure

### Introduction (2 min)

**Start recording:**
> "Hey [Name]! Before we start, I'm going to record this call so I can review details later. Is that okay with you?"

**Wait for confirmation.**

**Set expectations:**
> "Thanks for being one of our first 10 users. Here's how this works:
>
> - I'm going to watch you use MediaForge for the first time
> - I'll mostly stay quiet - don't worry if you get stuck, that's valuable feedback
> - Think out loud as you click around - tell me what you're looking for, what you expect to happen
> - Be brutally honest - I want to know what sucks, not what's good
>
> Sound good?"

**Get their context:**
> "Quick background: What do you currently use for illustrations or visuals?"

**Listen for:**
- Designer on team / Freelancer / Stock photos / Generic AI / Nothing structured
- Monthly spend on visuals
- Pain points with current solution

---

### Phase 1: Silent Observation (15 min)

#### First Login & Onboarding Flow

**Say this, then SHUT UP:**
> "Okay, share your screen and log in to MediaForge. I sent you the invite link via email. Just start clicking around - I'll watch silently for now."

**⏱️ Start timer - track time to first generation**

**What to observe (write down):**
- [ ] Smooth login or confusion
- [ ] Read welcome modal or dismiss immediately
- [ ] Understand the interface layout
- [ ] Know what to do first
- [ ] Where their eyes go (menu, buttons, examples)

**Resist helping for at least 60 seconds of hesitation**

#### First Generation (Preset Style)

**If they don't start generating after 2 minutes, prompt:**
> "No rush, but curious - what are you looking for right now?"

**Let them generate with a preset style first:**

**What to observe:**
- [ ] Understand style picker
- [ ] Know what prompt to enter (or struggle)
- [ ] Notice resolution selector
- [ ] See credit cost
- [ ] Understand loading state (10-30 sec wait)
- [ ] Reaction to first result

**If they nail it quickly (<2 min to first gen):**
> "Nice! That was fast. Was that intuitive or did something guide you?"

**If they struggle (>3 min to first gen):**
> "I see you're [describe what they're doing]. What are you trying to figure out?"

**⏱️ Stop timer - note time to first generation**

**Ask after first generation:**
1. "What do you think?"
2. "Would you use this?"
3. "What would you change about this?"

**Listen for quality bar expectations**

---

### Phase 2: Brand Training (The Critical Part) (10 min)

**Transition:**
> "Okay, now the exciting part - let's train the AI on YOUR brand style. This is what makes MediaForge different from ChatGPT or Midjourney.
>
> Go to Settings and click 'Train Your Brand.'
>
> I want you to do this exactly like I'm not here. If something's confusing, say it out loud. If you're not sure what to upload, tell me. Every bit of confusion helps me make this better."

#### Pre-Upload Assessment

**Before they select files, ask:**
> "Can you show me what you're planning to upload? Just show me the folder, don't upload yet."

**Observe their folder:**
- Organized or chaotic
- Lots of options or struggling to find 10 images
- Consistent style or mixed bag

**Key question:**
> "How did you decide which images to include?"

**Listen for:**
- Clear criteria (all blog headers, all same style)
- Uncertainty (not sure what "brand style" means)
- Limited options (don't have 10-30 examples)

#### Upload Process

**Watch silently as they upload:**

**⏱️ Track upload time**

**Friction points to note:**
- [ ] File size errors (images too small)
- [ ] Unclear on how many to upload
- [ ] Confusion about what qualifies as "brand image"
- [ ] Batch upload vs one-by-one

**If they struggle with "not enough images":**
> "How many brand illustrations do you typically use in a month? Where do they currently live?"

**This reveals if they're the right customer segment**

#### Brand Colors

**Watch them add colors:**

**Note:**
- [ ] Have hex codes ready
- [ ] Need to look them up
- [ ] Use eyedropper
- [ ] Don't know brand colors

**If they don't know hex codes:**
> "No worries - most people don't memorize those. Where would you normally find them?"

**This reveals documentation maturity**

#### Training Initiation

**After they hit "Start Training":**

**Critical observation - do they understand async?**

**Watch for:**
- [ ] Read "Training in background" message
- [ ] Immediately close modal and start generating
- [ ] Sit and wait (UX failure!)
- [ ] Look confused

**If they sit and wait:**
> "Oh, you can keep generating while it trains! Try another preset style."

**Note this as friction - not obvious enough**

**Set expectations:**
> "This'll take 15-30 minutes in the background. Let's keep generating with presets while we wait. I'll tell you when it's ready."

---

### Phase 3: First Brand Generation (THE MOMENT OF TRUTH) (8 min)

**When training completes:**

**If they notice the toast notification:**
> "Nice, you saw it! Go ahead and try generating with your brand."

**If they don't notice:**
> "Training's done - you should see 'Your Brand' in the style picker now."

**Note this as friction if missed**

#### The Silence Test

**DO NOT SPEAK during first brand generation:**

1. Watch their face
2. Watch their body language
3. Wait for THEM to speak first

**⏱️ Count seconds of silence - feels eternal but is valuable**

**Note their exact first words:**
> "_________________________________________________________________"

#### The Critical Questions (in order)

**Question 1:**
> "On a scale of 1-10, how 'on-brand' does this feel?"

**Wait for number, then:**
> "What makes it a [X]/10?"

**Listen for specifics:**
- Colors right/wrong
- Style close/far
- Usable/unusable

**Question 2:**
> "Show me an example of an illustration you love from your existing brand. Let's compare."

**Put them side-by-side**

**You assess using [quality rubric](brand-training-quality-rubric.md):**
- Color accuracy
- Style match
- Quality level
- Production-ready?

**Question 3:**
> "Would you actually publish this on your blog / social / [their use case]?"

**This is the truth moment:**
- Yes → Product works
- Maybe → Quality bar issue
- No → Missing the mark

**If "Maybe" or "No":**
> "What would need to change for it to be a 'yes'?"

**Write down exact blocker**

#### Iteration Test

**Prompt them:**
> "Generate 5 more with different prompts. I'll stay quiet and watch."

**Track consistency:**
- Are results consistent (7-10 scores)?
- Do they get better or worse?
- Does user get excited or frustrated?

**After 5 generations:**
> "How do you feel about the consistency? Getting what you expect?"

---

### Phase 4: Business Validation (5 min)

#### The Money Question (Direct)

> "Our Business plan is $29 a month. You get:
> - 200 credits (roughly 200 images at normal resolution)
> - Brand training included
> - Unlimited team members with shared credits
>
> Knowing what you know now, would you pay that?"

**Wait for answer. DO NOT fill silence.**

**If YES:**
> "What convinced you?"

**Listen for:**
- Value prop that resonated
- Comparison to alternative
- Specific use case ROI

**If NO or MAYBE:**
> "What would it take for this to be a no-brainer yes?"

**This tells you what to build next**

#### Competitive Context

> "What would you use instead? And how much does that cost?"

**Map out their alternatives:**
- Designer: $50-100/hour
- Stock photos: $29-99/month but generic
- Midjourney: $30/month but not brand-trained
- ChatGPT: Free but generic

**Key question:**
> "Why would you choose MediaForge over [their alternative]?"

**Or:**
> "Why would you NOT choose MediaForge?"

**This reveals positioning**

#### Team Dynamics

> "Would you invite teammates to use this? Who and why?"

**If YES:**
- Get names/roles
- Ask them to invite during call (test invite flow)
- See if teammate would join call briefly

**If NO:**
> "Is this more of a solo tool or are we missing something for teams?"

---

### Closing (2 min)

**Summary:**
> "This was super helpful. Quick recap:
> - You got to first generation in [X] minutes
> - Brand training felt like a [Score/10]
> - You [would / wouldn't] pay $29/month
> - The biggest thing you'd change is [X]
>
> Did I capture that right?"

**The Ask:**

> "Three things:
>
> 1. **Keep using it** - You have 3 months of Business free. Generate at least 20 images this week and tell me how it goes.
>
> 2. **Join our Slack/Discord** - [Send invite link] - Report bugs, request features, share what you make. I'm in there daily.
>
> 3. **Weekly check-in** - I'll ping you every Friday: 'How many images did you generate? What worked? What sucked?' Just reply with bullets, 2 minutes max.
>
> Sound good?"

**Thank them:**
> "You're literally shaping the product. If I ship something based on your feedback, I'll tag you and let you know. Thanks for being real with me."

**End recording**

- [ ] If zero usage → ping them: "Haven't seen you in the app, what's blocking you?"

---

## Red Flags - Abort Criteria

**If 3+ users out of 5 say:**
- "Preset styles are better than my brand" → Brand training not working
- "I'd just use ChatGPT" → No differentiation
- "Too expensive for what it does" → Pricing/value mismatch
- "Not production-ready" → Quality bar too low

**Action:** Stop onboarding new users, fix core issue, restart

---

## Success Signals - Keep Going

**If 3+ users out of 5:**
- Generate 20+ images in first session → High engagement
- Immediately invite teammates → Viral coefficient
- Ask about annual pricing → Ready to commit
- Show you where they published output → Production use

**Action:** Onboard next 5 users, prepare for payment launch

---

## Talking Points Library (For Common Questions)

**"How long does training take?"**
> "15-30 minutes, but it runs in the background. You can keep generating with preset styles while you wait."

**"Can I train multiple brands?"**
> "First one's included with Business. Additional brands are $29 each (one-time). Most teams only need one."

**"What if I don't like the results?"**
> "You can refresh your training for $5 - upload new images, tweak colors, retrain. Or just use preset styles."

**"How many images do I need to upload?"**
> "10 minimum, 30 maximum. More is better if they're consistent. If you only have 5 really good ones, that's a red flag that brand training might not be your use case yet."

**"Can I use this commercially?"**
> "Yep, royalty-free commercial license. Use them anywhere - blog, social, ads, presentations, docs."

**"Do you have an API?"**
> "Not yet. Would you use it? What's your use case?" [Gauge interest]

**"Can I export to Figma?"**
> "You can download PNG/JPEG and import to Figma. SVG export is coming soon. Figma plugin is on the roadmap - would that be valuable?"

**"What if my teammate generates something off-brand?"**
> "Everyone on your team uses the same trained brand AI. Results should be consistent. If they're not, that's a bug - tell me immediately."

## Difficult Scenarios

### Scenario: "I don't have 10-30 brand images"

**Response:**
> "No worries - that's actually good to know. Two options:
>
> 1. Use preset styles (Google, Notion, etc.) to generate a consistent set, then train on those
> 2. Start with presets and add brand training later when you have more examples
>
> Which sounds better for your workflow?"

**This tests if presets alone have value**

---

### Scenario: "The brand training doesn't look like my style at all"

**Deep dive required:**
> "Let's debug this together. Can you show me:
> 1. The images you uploaded
> 2. Your favorite example of your brand
> 3. The MediaForge output
>
> Let's compare side-by-side and figure out what's off."

**Possible issues:**
- They uploaded inconsistent images → Training confused
- Their "brand" isn't consistent → Not ready for brand training
- LoRA training failed → Technical bug
- Expectations mismatch → Thought it would be pixel-perfect

**Action:**
- If user error → Educate on what makes good training data
- If technical → File bug, offer to retrain manually
- If expectations → Reset expectations on AI limitations

---

### Scenario: "This is too expensive"

**Dig deeper:**
> "Help me understand - what would be a fair price for what you've seen?"

**If they say <$20:**
> "What are you comparing it to? What do you currently spend on visuals?"

**If they say Free:**
> "So you'd use ChatGPT or Midjourney instead?"

**This reveals if they're the right customer:**
- Right customer: Values brand training, compares to designer/agency costs
- Wrong customer: Wants generic AI, compares to free tools

---

### Scenario: "I need [missing feature] before I'd pay"

**Prioritization question:**
> "If we shipped [feature] next week, would you pay $29/month immediately?"

**If YES:**
- Add to priority backlog
- Tell them: "I'll personally email you when we ship it"

**If NO:**
- Probe: "What else would need to be true?"
- This reveals if feature is real blocker or excuse

---

## Iteration After Each Call

**After User 1:**
- Fix any critical bugs before User 2

**After User 3:**
- Identify pattern (same issue 2-3 times)
- Decide: Quick fix or keep observing?

**After User 5:**
- Retrospective: What's working? What's broken?
- Adjust script for Users 6-10 based on learnings

**After User 10:**
- Go/no-go decision on payment launch
- Pricing validation (did 7+ say yes to $29?)
- Feature prioritization (what did everyone request?)
