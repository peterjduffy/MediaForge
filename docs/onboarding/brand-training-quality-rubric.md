# Brand Training Quality Rubric

## Purpose
Objective framework for evaluating brand training output quality. Use this during user calls to assess whether brand training is working.

---

## Scoring System

### Overall On-Brand Score (1-10)

Use this during calls when asking: **"On a scale of 1-10, how on-brand does this feel?"**

| Score | Meaning | User Reaction | Business Impact |
|-------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **9-10** | üéØ **Exceptional** - Indistinguishable from human-created brand content | "Wow, that's spot-on!" / Immediately downloads | Will pay and invite team |
| **7-8** | ‚úÖ **Strong** - Clearly on-brand with minor tweaks needed | "That's pretty good" / Would use with light editing | Will pay if consistent |
| **5-6** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Acceptable** - Recognizably the brand but noticeably off | "It's close but..." / Hesitant to use | Might pay, needs work |
| **3-4** | ‚ùå **Weak** - Some brand elements present but mostly generic | "Not quite right" / Wouldn't use | Won't pay yet |
| **1-2** | üö´ **Failure** - No brand resemblance, generic AI output | "This isn't my brand" / Disappointed | Churn risk |

---

## Component Breakdown

Break down the overall score into specific dimensions for diagnosis.

### 1. Color Accuracy (1-10)

**What to evaluate:**
- Primary brand colors present and accurate
- Secondary/accent colors match
- Color palette proportions feel right
- No unexpected or off-brand colors

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 10 | Perfect color match, exact hex values | Brand colors #FF5733 and #3498DB are exactly right |
| 8 | Colors very close, slight shade variation | Brand blue is slightly lighter but still recognizable |
| 6 | Colors in the ballpark but noticeably off | Blue is there but looks more navy than sky blue |
| 4 | Some brand colors present, others wrong | Got primary color right but secondary is way off |
| 2 | Colors completely wrong or generic | Totally different palette, no brand colors visible |

**Red flags:**
- User says: "The colors are off"
- Side-by-side comparison shows clear mismatch
- Brand colors weren't uploaded correctly

**Fix:**
- Check color input (did they provide accurate hex codes?)
- Verify LoRA training included color conditioning
- May need to emphasize colors in prompt

---

### 2. Style Match (1-10)

**What to evaluate:**
- Illustration technique (flat, 3D, line art, gradient, etc.)
- Level of abstraction (realistic vs stylized)
- Shape language (geometric, organic, mixed)
- Texture and detail level

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 10 | Style is indistinguishable from brand examples | "I genuinely can't tell this wasn't made by our designer" |
| 8 | Style strongly resembles brand, minor differences | "Feels like our brand, maybe slightly more rounded" |
| 6 | Style somewhat similar but missing key elements | "It's flat design but ours has more texture" |
| 4 | Generic style that doesn't match brand | "This looks like generic AI, not our style" |
| 2 | Completely wrong style | "Our brand is minimalist line art, this is 3D rendered" |

**Red flags:**
- User says: "The style doesn't feel like us"
- Training images were inconsistent styles
- LoRA didn't capture distinctive style elements

**Fix:**
- Review training images for consistency
- May need more training images (closer to 30)
- Might need longer training time or better hyperparameters

---

### 3. Composition & Layout (1-10)

**What to evaluate:**
- Subject placement (centered, rule of thirds, etc.)
- Background vs foreground balance
- Negative space usage
- Visual hierarchy

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 10 | Composition matches brand conventions exactly | "We always center subjects, and it did that perfectly" |
| 8 | Composition feels on-brand with minor differences | "Usually we have more breathing room but this works" |
| 6 | Acceptable composition but doesn't feel branded | "It's fine but doesn't have our signature layout" |
| 4 | Composition feels generic or off | "Too cluttered - we're minimalist" |
| 2 | Composition actively contradicts brand style | "We never center subjects, always use asymmetry" |

**Red flags:**
- User says: "The layout is wrong"
- Composition doesn't match training examples
- Might be prompt issue vs training issue

**Fix:**
- Include composition keywords in prompt
- Check if training images had consistent composition
- May need to guide users on prompt engineering

---

### 4. Brand Elements & Motifs (1-10)

**What to evaluate:**
- Recurring visual elements (shapes, patterns, icons)
- Character style consistency (if applicable)
- Signature details (shadows, outlines, highlights)
- Brand-specific quirks

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 10 | All signature brand elements present | "It has our rounded corners and subtle gradients - perfect" |
| 8 | Most key elements present, minor details missing | "Has our character style but missing our signature shadow" |
| 6 | Some elements present but inconsistent | "Sometimes has our style, sometimes generic" |
| 4 | Few or no distinctive brand elements | "Could be anyone's illustration, no unique details" |
| 2 | Completely generic, no brand markers | "This is just stock AI art" |

**Red flags:**
- User says: "It's missing the thing that makes it ours"
- Can't identify any unique brand markers
- LoRA didn't learn distinctive elements

**Fix:**
- Training images need more consistency in key elements
- May need to emphasize elements in prompt
- Might need stronger LoRA training weight

---

### 5. Production Readiness (1-10)

**What to evaluate:**
- Technical quality (resolution, clarity)
- Edge cases handled well (text, faces, complex objects)
- Consistency across multiple generations
- Requires editing or ready to publish

| Score | Description | User Behavior |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 10 | Perfect, publish immediately | Downloads and uses without edits |
| 8 | Minor cleanup needed (crop, color adjust) | Downloads with plan to lightly edit |
| 6 | Needs moderate editing in Figma/Illustrator | "I'd need to clean this up first" |
| 4 | Major edits required | "Easier to start from scratch" |
| 2 | Unusable, fundamental issues | Doesn't download, tries again |

**Red flags:**
- User says: "I'd need to heavily edit this"
- Artifacts, distortions, or quality issues
- Inconsistent quality across generations

**Fix:**
- May be prompt issue (too complex, conflicting keywords)
- Could be model limitation (Imagen 3 vs SDXL differences)
- Might need better training data quality

---

## Diagnostic Matrix

Use this to quickly diagnose issues during calls.

| User Says... | Likely Issue | Quick Test | Fix |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-----|
| "Colors are off" | Color accuracy | Compare hex codes side-by-side | Re-check color inputs, retrain with emphasis on colors |
| "Doesn't feel like my style" | Style match | Show training images vs output | Need more consistent training data |
| "It's too generic" | Brand elements missing | Ask what makes their brand unique | LoRA not strong enough, increase training weight |
| "Sometimes good, sometimes bad" | Consistency | Generate 5 more in a row | Prompt engineering needed, or LoRA instability |
| "Not good enough to use" | Production readiness | Ask what specific changes needed | May need model upgrade or post-processing |
| "Preset styles are better" | Training failed | Compare preset vs brand output | Critical failure - investigate training logs |

---

## Comparative Assessment

### Side-by-Side Test

During calls, always do this test:

1. Ask user to show their **favorite** existing brand illustration
2. Generate similar prompt with MediaForge
3. Put them **side-by-side** on screen
4. Ask: **"What's the same? What's different?"**

**Scoring criteria:**

| Similarity Level | Score | User Reaction | Action |
|------------------|-------|---------------|--------|
| **Nearly Identical** | 9-10 | "Wow, I honestly can't tell the difference" | Success! Document what worked |
| **Clearly Similar** | 7-8 | "Definitely the same family, minor differences" | Good enough - note differences for iteration |
| **Somewhat Similar** | 5-6 | "I can see the connection but it's noticeably different" | Needs work - prioritize fixing gaps |
| **Vaguely Similar** | 3-4 | "There are hints of our style but mostly different" | Major issues - debug training |
| **Not Similar** | 1-2 | "These don't look related at all" | Training failed - investigate immediately |

---

## Consistency Test

### Multi-Generation Consistency

After first generation, have user generate **5 more** with different prompts.

**Track scores for each:**

| Generation | Prompt | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | "Team collaboration" | 8 | Good colors, style slightly off |
| 2 | "Data analytics" | 7 | Colors perfect, composition generic |
| 3 | "Customer success" | 9 | Best one yet! |
| 4 | "Product launch" | 6 | Colors shifted, style inconsistent |
| 5 | "Remote work" | 8 | Back to good |

**Average score:** _____ / 10

**Consistency assessment:**

| Average Score | Variance | Assessment | Business Impact |
|---------------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **8-10** | Low (<2 points) | Excellent - production ready | User will pay and use heavily |
| **7-8** | Low (<2 points) | Good - reliable with minor tweaks | User will pay if consistent |
| **6-8** | High (3+ points) | Inconsistent - reliability issue | User hesitant due to unpredictability |
| **<6** | Any | Poor - not ready for production | User won't pay yet |

**Red flags:**
- Scores vary by 3+ points ‚Üí Consistency problem
- Later generations worse than first ‚Üí Prompt drift or randomness
- User stops generating ‚Üí Frustrated with quality
