# Brand Training Best Practices

## Overview
Brand training teaches the AI your specific illustration style. Good training data = better results. Bad data = unpredictable output.

**Training time**: 15-30 minutes (runs in background)
**Cost**: Included with Business tier ($29/mo)

## ✓ What Makes Good Training Images

### 1. **Consistent Style**
- All 10-30 images should be in the **same visual style**
- Same color palette, line weight, shading approach
- Don't mix flat illustrations with 3D renders
- Don't mix cartoon style with realistic illustrations

**Example Good Set:**
- 20 Google-style flat illustrations
- All have same color treatment
- Consistent geometric shapes
- Similar level of detail

**Example Bad Set:**
- 10 flat icons + 10 detailed 3D renders
- Some cartoon, some realistic
- Mixed color palettes

---

### 2. **High Resolution**
- **Minimum**: 1024×1024px per image
- **Recommended**: 1536×1536px or larger
- Sharp, crisp images (not blurry or pixelated)
- PNG or JPG format

**Test**: Zoom in 200% - if it looks blurry, it's too low-res

---

### 3. **Variety of Subjects**
Upload different types of scenes/objects:
- People (different poses, activities)
- Objects (laptops, phones, coffee cups)
- Scenes (offices, homes, outdoor)
- Abstract concepts (growth charts, connections)

**Why**: Helps AI learn your style across all use cases

---

### 4. **Clean Compositions**
- Focus on the illustration itself
- Minimal or no text overlays
- Clean backgrounds (solid color or simple)
- No UI elements (buttons, menus)
- No watermarks or logos overlapping the art

**Good**: Standalone illustration on white/transparent background
**Bad**: Screenshot of illustration in a design mockup

---

### 5. **Actual Brand Work (Ideal)**
Best results = your existing brand illustrations

**If you have them:**
- Marketing site illustrations
- Product screenshots (illustration parts only)
- Social media graphics
- Presentation slides
- Brand guidelines examples

**If you don't have them:**
- Find 10-30 illustrations in the style you want
- Make sure they're all consistent with each other
- Consider buying a style pack from Dribbble/Creative Market

---

## ✗ What to Avoid

### ❌ Photos
The AI is trained for illustrations, not photos.
- No stock photos
- No product photography
- No real-world images

**Exception**: If you want a specific photo-realistic illustration style, upload photo-realistic *illustrations*, not actual photos.

---

### ❌ Screenshots with UI
- Don't upload full website screenshots
- Don't include browser chrome, toolbars, menus
- Crop to just the illustration part

---

### ❌ Mixed Styles
Training on inconsistent styles confuses the AI.

**Bad example:**
- 10 minimalist flat icons
- 10 detailed gradient illustrations
- 10 hand-drawn sketchy illustrations

**Result**: Unpredictable, inconsistent output

---

### ❌ Text-Heavy Images
- Avoid images where text is the main element
- Infographics with lots of labels = bad training data
- Logos with just text = bad

**Why**: AI focuses on text instead of style

---

### ❌ Watermarked/Copyrighted Content
- Don't use images with visible watermarks
- Don't use copyrighted work you don't own
- Stick to your own brand assets or licensed content

---

## Example Training Sets

### ✓ Good: SaaS Brand
**Style**: Modern flat illustrations with gradients
- 15 images of people using laptops
- 5 images of abstract data/charts
- 5 images of team collaboration scenes
- 5 images of office/workspace setups

**All 30 images:**
- Same color palette (blues, purples, oranges)
- Same gradient treatment
- Same level of detail
- Same geometric style

---

### ✓ Good: Playful Startup
**Style**: Hand-drawn, slightly sketchy
- 20 images of quirky characters
- 5 images of office scenes
- 5 images of tech objects (phones, laptops)

**All 30 images:**
- Hand-drawn aesthetic
- Same line weight
- Same color treatment (limited palette)
- Consistent "imperfect" look

---

### ✗ Bad: Mixed Bag
- 5 realistic 3D renders
- 5 flat minimalist icons
- 10 photos with illustration overlays
- 5 cartoon-style characters
- 5 abstract geometric patterns

**Problem**: No consistent style = AI can't learn

---

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. **Start with 15-20 Images**
More isn't always better. 15 high-quality, consistent images > 30 mediocre ones.

### 2. **Test Before Full Set**
Upload 10 images → test → if good, upload 10 more

### 3. **Use Your Best Work**
Pick your favorite existing illustrations. The AI will learn from quality.

### 4. **When in Doubt, Be Consistent**
Same style > variety of subjects
Better to have 20 images of the same type of scene in perfect style consistency than 30 varied scenes with style drift.

### 5. **Refresh After Major Brand Changes**
If you redesign your brand, retrain with new assets (1 free refresh/month on Business plan)

## Common Questions

**Q: I don't have 10 brand illustrations yet. What do I do?**
**A:** Find a style pack or existing illustrations you like (licensed/free to use), upload those to train your initial style. Refresh later with your own work.

**Q: Can I train on Midjourney/DALL-E images?**
**A:** Yes, if they're consistent and represent the style you want. Make sure you have rights to use them.

**Q: What if my brand has 2 different illustration styles?**
**A:** Pick one for training. You can refresh to the other style later, or use preset styles for variation.

**Q: How do I know if my training worked well?**
**A:** Generate 3-5 test images with different prompts. If they all look consistent and on-brand, you're good.

**Q: My results aren't matching my brand. What went wrong?**
**A:** Most common: mixed styles in training data. Review your images - are they truly consistent? Use your 1 free refresh/month to retrain with better data.
